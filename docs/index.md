## About Us
Vithai is a non-profitable trust founded in 2013 by a group of like-minded school/college friends from different towns in Tamil Nadu. We formed this trust with a vision to transform and uplift the lives of students in the rural regions of Tamil Nadu through student education, by providing financial assistance and distributing notebooks to them. 

Vithai also creates awareness among the school students about the need of planting more trees by issuing saplings every year. 

## Key Highlights
Vithai has paid the [tuition fee](./activities//tuition-fee.md) for more than 200+ students and has distributed close to 1500 [notebooks](./activities/notebooks.md)  & 8000+ [saplings](./activities/plantation.md) to school students since 2013.
