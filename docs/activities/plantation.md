In the mission of creating environmental awareness among young and future generations to understand global warming, healthy living, water conservation, and the importance of a clean environment, Vithai is conducting a plantation drive every year for the birth anniversary of former president ```Dr. APJ Adbul Kalam```.

Mostly saplings that would survive tropical drought conditions and are environment friendlies like Pungan, Mango, and Neem are widely picked for plantation.
